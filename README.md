# Yoda NFC Keychain
This project is a Yoda-shaped NFC Keychain. It's in the overall shape of a Yoda, and ingrained on each of its sides are my initials, personalizing the keychain for me to use. There is a cavity for an NFC sticker to be inserted into it, allowing for it to interact with devices through NFC. 

## Motivation for This Project
This project was inspired by Hack Club's Asylum YSWS, where one of the challenges was to create an NFC keychain. However, during the span of that program, I was too busy to make a keychain. However, I think it's not only super cool but also very useful to be able to use a personalized keychain to interact with devices, which is why I am creating one now for Hack Club's Highway program.
